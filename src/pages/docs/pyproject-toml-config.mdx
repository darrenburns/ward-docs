You can configure Ward using the standard `pyproject.toml` configuration file, defined in
[PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/).

You *don't* need a `pyproject.toml` file to use Ward.

Ward will read your `pyproject.toml` file and treat the values inside it as defaults.

If you pass an option via the command line that also appears in your `pyproject.toml`,
the option supplied via the command line takes priority.

## Where Ward looks for `pyproject.toml`

In summary, the process it uses is:

* Find the common base directory of all files passed in via the `--path` option (default to the current working directory).
* Starting from this directory, look at all parent directories, and return the file if it is found.
* If a directory contains a `.git` directory/file, a `.hg` directory, or the `pyproject.toml` file, stop searching.

This is the same process [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) (the popular code formatting tool) uses to discover the file.

## Example `pyproject.toml`

The `pyproject.toml` file contains different sections for different tools. Ward uses the `[tool.ward]` section.

```text
[tool.ward]
path = ["unit_tests", "integration_tests"]  # supply multiple paths using a list
capture-output = false  # enable or disable output capturing (e.g. to use debugger)
order = "standard"  # or 'random'
output-mode = "test-per-line"  # or 'dots-global', 'dot-module'
fail-limit = 20  # stop the run if 20 fails occur
search = "my_function"  # search in test body or description
```
