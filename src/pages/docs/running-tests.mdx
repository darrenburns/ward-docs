import {TerminalCommand, TestOutputLine, TerminalText, TerminalExample, Green, Red, Blue} from "../../components/ward-test-output"

To find and run tests in your project, you can run `ward` without
any arguments.

<TerminalCommand>ward</TerminalCommand>

This will recursively search through the current directory
for modules with a name starting with `test_`, and execute
any tests contained in the modules it finds.

## Customising the output with `--test-output-style`

<TerminalCommand>ward --test-output-style [<Blue>test-per-line</Blue>|<Blue>dots-module</Blue>|<Blue>dots-global</Blue>]</TerminalCommand>

As your project grows, it may become impractical to print
each test result on its own line. Ward provides alternative
test output styles that can be configured using the
`--test-output-style` option.

### `test-per-line`
The default test output of Ward looks like this (`--test-output-style=test-per-line`):

<TerminalExample>
    <TerminalText>
      <TestOutputLine lineNumber="3" marker="PASS" moduleName="test_earth"
                      description="it is not flat"/>
      <TestOutputLine lineNumber="11" marker="PASS" moduleName="test_earth"
                      description="24 hours to rotate"/>
      <TestOutputLine lineNumber="4" marker="FAIL" moduleName="test_sun"
                      description="it is hot"/>
    </TerminalText>
</TerminalExample>

### `dots-module`
If you run Ward with `--test-output-style=dots-module`, each
module will be printed on its own line, and a single character
will be used to represent the outcome of each test in that
module:

<TerminalExample>
    <TerminalText>
      tests/test_earth.py: <Green>..</Green><br/>
      tests/test_sun.py: <Red>F</Red>
    </TerminalText>
</TerminalExample>

### `dots-global`
If that is still too verbose, you may wish to represent every
test outcome with a single character, without grouping them by
modules (`--test-output-style=dots-global`):

<TerminalExample>
    <TerminalText>
      <Green>..</Green><Red>F</Red>
    </TerminalText>
</TerminalExample>

## Test selection

### Search and run matching tests with `--search`

You can choose to limit which tests are collected and ran by Ward 
using the `--search STRING` option. Test names, descriptions *and test function bodies*
will be searched, and those which contain `STRING` will be ran. Here are
some examples:

**Run all tests that call the `fetch_users` function:**
```text
ward --search "fetch_users("
```

**Run all tests that check if a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised:**
```text
ward --search "raises(ZeroDivisionError)"
```

**Run all tests decorated with the `@xfail` decorator:**
```text
ward --search "@xfail"
```

**Run a test called `test_the_sky_is_blue`:**

```text
ward --search test_the_sky_is_blue
```

**Run a test described as `"my_function should return False"`:**

```text
ward --search "my_function should return False"
```

**Running tests inside a module:**

The search takes place on the fully qualified name, so you can run a single
module (e.g. `my_module`) using the following command:

```text
ward --search my_module.
```

Of course, if a test name or body contains the string `"my_module."`, that test
will also be selected and ran. 

This approach is useful for quickly querying tests and running those which match a
simple query, making it useful for development.

### Specific test selection

Sometimes you want to be very specific when declaring which tests to run.

Ward will provide an option to query tests on name and description using substring
or regular expression matching.

(TODO)

### Running tests in a directory

You can run tests in a specific directory using the `--path` option.
For example, to run all tests inside a directory called `tests`:

```text
ward --path tests
```

To run tests in the current directory, you can just type `ward`, which
is functionally equivalent to `ward --path .`

## Skipping a test

Use the `@skip` annotation to tell Ward not to execute a test.

```python
from ward import skip

@skip
def test_to_be_skipped():
    # ...
```

You can pass a `reason` to the `skip` decorator, and it will be printed
next to the test name/description during the run.

```python
@skip("not implemented yet")
@test("everything is okay")
def _():
    # ...
```

Here's the output Ward will print to the console when it runs the test above:

```text
SKIP  test_things: everything is okay  [not implemented yet]
```

## Cancelling a run after a specific number of failures

If you wish for Ward to cancel a run immediately after a specific number of failing tests,
you can use the `--fail-limit` option. To have a run end immediately after 5 tests fail:

```text
ward --fail-limit 5
```
