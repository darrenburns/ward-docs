## Descriptive testing

Tests aren't only a great way of ensuring your code behaves correctly, they're also a fantastic form of documentation.
Therefore, a test framework should make describing your tests in a clear and concise manner as simple as possible.

Ward lets you describe your tests using strings, allowing you to be as descriptive
as you'd like:

```python
from ward import test

@test("simple addition")
def _():
    assert 1 + 2 == 3
```

The description of a test is a [format string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax), and may
refer to any of the parameters (variables or fixtures) present in the test signature. This
makes it easy to keep your test data and test descriptions in sync.


```python
@fixture
def three():
    yield 3

@test("{a} + {b} == {result}")
def _(a=1, b=2, result=three):
    assert a + b == result
```

During the test run, Ward will print the descriptive test name to the console:

<TerminalExample>
    <TestOutputLine marker="FAIL" lineNumber="7" moduleName="test_math" description="1 + 2 == 3" />
</TerminalExample>

Tests will only be collected from modules with names that start with `"test_"` or end with `"_test"`.

## Testing `async` code

You can declare any test or fixture as `async` in order to test asynchronous code:

```python
@fixture
async def post():
    return await create_post("hello world")

@test("a newly created post has no children")
async def _(p=post):
    children = await p.children
    assert children == [] 

@test("a newly created post has an id > 0")
def _(p=post):
    assert p.id > 0
```

## Tagging tests

You can tag tests using the `tags` keyword argument of the `@test` decorator:

```python
@test("simple addition", tags=["unit", "regression"])
def _():
    assert 1 + 2 == 3
```

Tags provide a powerful means of grouping tests and associating queryable metadata with them.

When running your tests, you can filter which ones you want to run using tag expressions.

Here are some ways you could use tags:

* Linking a test to a ticket from an issue tracker: `"BUG-123"`, `"PULL-456"`, etc.
* Describe what type of test it is: `"small"`, `"medium"`, `"big"`, `"unit"`, `"integration"`, etc.
* Specify which endpoint your test calls: `"/users"`, `"/tweets"`, etc.
* Specify which platform a test targets: `"windows"`, `"unix"`, `"ios"`, `"android"`

With your tests tagged you can now run only the tests you care about. To ask Ward to run only
integration tests which target any mobile platform, you might invoke it like so:

<TerminalCommand>
ward --tags "integration and (ios or android)"
</TerminalCommand> 

For a deeper look into tag expressions, see the [running tests](/guide/running-tests) page.

## Using `assert`

Ward lets you use plain `assert` statements when writing your tests, but gives you considerably
more information should the assertion fail than a typical `assert` statement. It does this by 
modifying the abstract syntax tree (AST) of any collected tests. Occurrences of the `assert`
statement are replaced with a function call, depending on which comparison operator was used.

Currently, Ward only rewrites `assert` statements that appear directly in the body of your tests.
If you use helper methods that contain `assert` statements and would like detailed output, you can 
use the helper `assert_{op}` methods in `ward.expect`.

## Parameterised testing

A parameterised test is where you define a single test that runs multiple times, 
with different arguments being injected on each run.

Ward supports parameterised testing by allowing multiple fixtures or
values to be bound as a keyword argument using the `each` function:

```python
from ward import each, fixture, test

@fixture
def six():
    return 6

@test("an example of parameterisation")
def _(
    a=each(1, 2, 3),
    b=each(2, 4, six),
):
    assert a * 2 == b
```

Although the example above is written as a single test,
Ward will generate and run 3 distinct tests from it at run-time: one for each item passed into `each`.

The variables `a` and `b` take the values `a=1` and `b=2` in the first test,
`a=2` and `b=4` in the second test, and the third test will be passed the values `a=3` and `b=6`.

If any of the items inside `each` is a fixture, that fixture will be resolved 
and injected. Each of the test runs are considered *unique tests* from 
a [fixture scoping](/guide/fixtures) perspective.

<Warning>
**Warning**: All occurrences of `each` in a test signature must contain the same number of arguments.
</Warning>
<br/>

Using `each` in a test signature doesn't stop you from injecting other fixtures as normal.

```python
from ward import each, fixture, test

@fixture
def book_api():
   return BookApi()

@test("BookApi.get_book returns the correct book given an ISBN")
def _(
   api=book_api,
   isbn=each("0765326353", "0765326361", "076532637X"),
   name=each("The Way of Kings", "Words of Radiance", "Oathbringer"),
)
   book: Book = api.get_book(isbn)
   assert book.name == name
```

Ward will expand the parameterised test above into 3 distinct tests.

In other words, the single parameterised test above is functionally equivalent to the 3 tests shown below.

```python
@test("[1/3] BookApi.get_book returns the correct book given an ISBN")
def _(
   api=book_api,
   isbn="0765326353",
   name="The Way of Kings",
)
   book: Book = api.get_book(isbn)
   assert book.name == name

@test("[2/3] BookApi.get_book returns the correct book given an ISBN")
def _(
   api=book_api,
   isbn="0765326361",
   name="Words of Radiance",
)
   book: Book = api.get_book(isbn)
   assert book.name == name

@test("[3/3] BookApi.get_book returns the correct book given an ISBN")
def _(
   api=book_api,
   isbn="076532637X",
   name="Oathbringer",
)
   book: Book = api.get_book(isbn)
   assert book.name == name
```

If you'd like to use the same `book_api` instance across each of the three generated tests, 
you'd have to increase its scope to `module` or `global`.

Currently, `each` can only be used in the signature of *tests*.

## Checking for exceptions

The test below will pass, because a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised. If a `ZeroDivisionError` wasn't raised,
the test would fail.

```python
from ward import raises, test

@test("a ZeroDivision error is raised when we divide by 0")
def _():
    with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        1/0
```

If you need to access the exception object that your code raised, you can
use `with raises(<exc_type>) as <exc_object>`.

```python
def my_func():
    raise Exception("oh no!")

@test("the message is 'oh no!'")
def _():
    with raises(Exception) as ex:
        my_func()
    assert str(ex.raised) == "oh no!"
```

Note that `ex` is only populated after the context manager exits, so
be careful with your indentation.

  description={"This test checks that a call to 'expect.equals' raises an ExpectationFailed error if the arguments are not equal."} />

## Skipping a test

Use the `@skip` decorator to tell Ward not to execute a test.

```python
from ward import skip

@skip
@test("I will be skipped!")
def _():
    # ...
```

You can pass a `reason` to the `skip` decorator, and it will be printed
next to the test name/description during the run.

```python
@skip("not implemented yet")
@test("everything is okay")
def _():
    # ...
```

When we <SkipMarker>SKIP</SkipMarker> a test, like the one above, Ward will clearly highlight this
in its output:

<TerminalExample>
    <TestOutputLine marker="SKIP" moduleName="test_things" lineNumber="14" description="everything is okay" note="[not implemented yet]"/>
</TerminalExample>


## Expecting a test to fail

You can mark a test that you expect to fail with the `@xfail` decorator. 

```python
from ward import xfail

@xfail("its really not okay")
@test("everything is okay")
def _():
    # ...
```

If a test decorated with `@xfail` *does* indeed fail as we expected, it is shown
in the results as an <XfailMarker>XFAIL</XfailMarker>:

<TerminalExample>
    <TestOutputLine marker="XFAI" moduleName="test_things" lineNumber="14" description="everything is okay" note="[its really not okay]"/>
</TerminalExample>

If a test marked with this decorator passes unexpectedly, it is known as an <XpassMarker>XPASS</XpassMarker> (an unexpected pass), which will
be displayed as shown below.

<TerminalExample>
    <TestOutputLine marker="XPAS" moduleName="test_things" lineNumber="14" description="everything is okay" note="[its really not okay]"/>
</TerminalExample>

If an <XpassMarker>XPASS</XpassMarker> occurs during a run, that run will be considered a failure.

## Using Hypothesis with Ward

To use [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io) with Ward, you'll have to use the `@using` decorator
to inject fixtures, because Hypothesis doesn't permit the use of default arguments.
