## Tagging tests
Use the free-form nature of test descriptions to your advantage.
Put tags in your test descriptions to make it easy to select and
 run a specific subset of tests.

For example, you could mark tests with performance issues as "slow":

```python
@test("[slow] fetch the entire transaction log")
def _(client=client):
    log = client.fetch_entire_log()
    expect(log).equals([6, 2, 3, 1, 50])
```  

Now you can run all tests that have been tagged as such:

<TerminalCommand>ward --search <Blue>"[slow]"</Blue></TerminalCommand>

Another useful pattern is tagging tests with the 
name of the function or method they're testing so that you can easily
 run all tests that test a specific method. For example *"run all
tests where the method under test is `MyCounter.increment`"*:

```python
@test("[MyCounter.increment] works for negative integers")
def _():
    m = MyCounter(initial=-1)
    expect(m.increment()).equals(0)
    
@test("[MyCounter.increment] works for positive integers")
def _():
    m = MyCounter(initial=1)
    expect(m.increment()).equals(2)
```

Now if we wished to run only tests that probe the `MyCounter.increment` method,
we can run the following command:

<TerminalCommand>ward --search <Blue>"[MyCounter.increment]"</Blue></TerminalCommand>
