## Tagging tests
Use the free-form nature of test descriptions to your advantage.
Put tags in your test descriptions to make it easy to select and
 run a specific subset of tests.

For example, you could mark tests with performance issues as "slow":

```python
@test("[slow] fetch the entire transaction log")
def _(client=client):
    log = client.fetch_entire_log()
    expect(log).equals([6, 2, 3, 1, 50])
```  

Now you can run all tests that have been tagged as such:

<TerminalCommand>ward --search <Blue>"[slow]"</Blue></TerminalCommand>
